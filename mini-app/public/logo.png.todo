A stylized calendar page with a large, bold number indicating the date, surrounded by icons of various cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc.) in a subtle gradient. The background is a soft pastel blue with a faint grid pattern, giving a clean, modern look. The calendar should have a small, translucent overlay of a lock symbol to hint at “unlock” events. The overall composition is balanced, with the icons arranged around the calendar in a semi‑circular fashion, and the text “Token Unlock Calendar” subtly integrated into the top banner in a sleek sans‑serif font.
